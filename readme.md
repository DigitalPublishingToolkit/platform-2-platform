===================

This project is part of Institute of Network Cultures' [Making Public project](http://networkcultures.org/makingpublic/).

We're building an article suggestion system by indexing in a common database the articles of the three online journals taking part in the project. We're doing this by mixing algorithmic suggetions with human editorial choice.

Whenever you're reading an article from Journal 1, you'll get suggestions in the form of online ads, from Journal 2 and 3. Suggestions are based on article topic, title, author, keywoards and text analysis.

We're re-creating a web-ring on a bigger-scale.
